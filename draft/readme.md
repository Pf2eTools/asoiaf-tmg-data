# ASOIAF:TMG - DRAFT

Draft armies using https://draftmancer.com by uploading `cube.txt` as a custom card list.

### Draft procedure
We use packs of size 10 as an example.
1. Packs that contain everything you need to create an asoiaf army are randomly generated. Each pack contains 10 items (combat units, ncus, commanders, attachments, and basedecks).
2. Each player is assigned a pack. The contents of the packs are hidden to the other players.
3. Each player looks at the content of their pack, secretly chooses an item, and returns the other items to the pack.
4. Once all players have made their choice, each player passes their pack on to their neighbor.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the packs are empty.
6. Repeat steps 2-5. At the end of this step, each player should have picked 20 items.
7. Each player reveals their picks.
8. Each player builds a single 40 point army from the 20 items they picked. There are additional listbuilding rules detailed below.
9. Reset everything, then repeat steps 1-8 for each player to build their second list.

### Suggested Draft Rules
For these rules, "item" refers to any combat unit, ncu, attachment, commander, or basedeck.
- Your list may include items from any number of factions. There is no neutral point limit.
- You may ignore rules that require you to field other characters. *(For example, you may select dragons without Dany.)*
- If an item has a "Loyalty" rule, you may ignore that rule.
- If a combat unit requires you to attach a specific character, you may ignore that rule if you don't include that character as an attachment in your list.
- For all purposes except "Raiders of the Iron Islands" (Pillage), each of your combat units counts as belonging to every faction.
- Balon NCU can only use his abilty on Infantry units.
- If your commander requires you to remove a card from your tactics deck, and you can't remove that card, you may choose which card to remove before each game. You must show your opponent the card you removed.
