The rank-and-file Lannister forces enjoy a battlefield superiority borne of strong armor, heavy metal shields, and the sense of invulnerability that goes with it. Most enemies of House Lannister prove incapable of even making a dent in such stalwart lines."

Halberd",,SIF001/SIF001B/SIF202,10102,2021-S02,,,"While capable of mounting offensive assaults, House Lannister’s Halberdiers excel in defensive formations and positions. Charging enemies should think twice before facing an entrenched Halberdier line. Care should be taken to shield Halberdiers from flanking maneuvers or ranged fire, but, when properly employed, nothing gets past a Halberdier’s deadly blade."

Prey On Fear",,SIF001/SIF203,10103,2021-S03,,,"Brutal, savage, merciless, and ferocious, the Mountain’s Men bring the art of warfare to new lows. They accept no quarter. Those that flee are cut down. Those that surrender are run through. The Mountain’s Men excel at striking enemy troops already beleaguered by regular forces, and shattering their will to fight. Care must be taken not to let these ruthless men too far off their leash."

Horrific Visage",,SIF204,10104,2021-S03,,,"Pyromancers from the Alchemists’ Guild employ House Lannister’s most fearsome and devastating weapon: Wildfire. Known as ‘the substance’, Wildfire is a green-tinted liquid of remarkable destructive potential. Its volatility makes transporting and employing the substance hazardous in and of itself, yet, no unit of mere mortal men can endure its assault. Even the thickest armor is useless against its clinging, pernicious flames."

Cavalry /
Lance",,SIF205,10105,S05,,,"Expensively armed, expensively armored, and trained to perfection, the Knights of Casterly Rock bring unparalleled speed and lethality to the Lion banner. Few enemies are equipped to withstand a charge from these heavily armored juggernauts, and fewer still match their speed. While they can be bogged down in melee against determined infantry, few commanders let them remain so encumbered for long."

Yet, the crossbow itself is more costly to manufacture and maintain, especially in battlefield conditions. With even minimal training, Crossbowmen can fire accurately and pierce thick armor even under the pressure of a direct charge. Though no Lannister commander places their Crossbowmen anywhere near a melee, if it can be helped!"

Such a massive man requires a mount of similar proportions, though the largest of steeds appear as mere ponies beneath the Mountain That Rides. Units under the Mountain’s command hit like an avalanche, and leave similar destruction in their wake. The Mountain is an utterly merciless opponent, a true weapon of muscle and steel."

Zealous Resurgence",,SIF208,10109,2021-S01,,,"While unarmored and wielding naught but improvised or scavenged weapons, only a foolish commander would discount the Poor Fellows on the battlefield. Their vast numbers and unshakable faith in the Seven let the Poor Fellows fight on where units of less-devout men would break and flee.

Your army may not include Jaime Lannister. Joffrey must be attached to this unit.*",,"As a unit, the Kingsguard are the best-armed, best-armored, and most experienced troops in the War of the Five Kings. Though they suffer from the usual weakness of any heavy infantry if they become surrounded, they are also hobbled with one additional irritant: King Joffrey Baratheon. Still, despite being but seven men, the Kingsguard can successfully assault or defend against three times their number."

Lannister Justice",,SIF211,10111,2021-S01,,,"Lannister Red Cloaks are elite guardsmen who serve as the enforcement arm of House Lannister in King’s Landing and Casterly Rock. Their job is to keep the population in check through intimidation, fear, and sharp blades. They’re notable not just for their crimson cloaks, but also their half-plate armor, itself as well-made as mass-produced armor can be. They’re solid medium infantry, and among the best-paid troops in the Lannister roster."

Brutal Armaments",,SIF214/SIF001B,10112,2021-S02,,,"While most cavalry assaults are savage enough, Gregor Clegane’s bands of mounted brigands take brutality beyond all norms. It’s not enough for them to simply shred enemy ranks from the flanks or rear. For the type of man drawn to Clegane’s ranks, a weapon that leaves an enemy crippled and shattered is as good as one that kills swiftly and efficiently. Yet, for all their fearsome reputation, Brigands have little thirst for fair fights."

Domineering Pride",,SIF212,10113,S04,,,"As watchmen for House Lannister’s seat of power, the Lannisport City Watch is armed and armored as well (if not better) than many front-line troops in the War of the Five Kings. That said, they’re not regular soldiers, and should not be relied upon to hold the vanguard or stand against a furious cavalry charge. That said, when in large numbers and properly supported, they remain effective and dangerous, a truly excellent support unit."

As such its guardians, the renowned Casterly Rock Honor Guard also serve as symbols of unbreakable Lannister might. Outfitted in the finest plate armor money can buy, and trained as a heavy response force to local threats, the Honor Guard can stand the line and exploit enemy vulnerabilities as they reveal themselves."

He may be attached to this unit at no cost.*,,"As mountain tribes and raiders go, Tyrion Lannister’s Stone Crows are quite ordinary, save their unexpected loyalty. While pledged more to Tyrion’s coin than his person, they proved true to their word, even when betrayal might have been a more lucrative option. As mercenaries, these troops are worth their coin, if properly employed as scouts and flankers. Their light arms and armor make them unsuited to the front line in  a protracted engagement."

Brave, capable, and overwhelmingly loyal to the Direwolf banner, Sworn Swords would rather perish to a man than abandon their brothers in battle.

Ambush",,SIF001/SIF102,10202,S04,,,"While not built for a sustained melee engagement, House Stark’s Outriders rarely find themselves so encumbered. Unfettered mobility is their hallmark, with lightly armored troops and unarmored mounts chosen and trained for speed and calm temperament. While they suffer the usual vulnerability to arrows shared by light troops, Outriders consider archers as natural prey. Outriders can close with and shatter an unprotected archery line with ease."

A wise commander must take care not to allow them such free rein to find themselves overwhelmed.

Faster than any man on foot, and nearly as swift as any steed, Grey Wind uses instinct alone to guide him where he’s most needed on the battlefield. While his individual combat prowess is impressive, the outright panic he sows provides tremendous tactical value."

While marginally effective at short range, and very vulnerable in a pitched melee or a cavalry assault, House Stark’s bowmen will pin down or even outright eradicate enemy opposition at long range."

Stubborn Tenacity",,SIF105,10206,S05,,,"House Tully’s Sworn Shields bring superior armor and defensive power to the battlefield under the greater banner of House Stark. With their ability to absorb nearly any determined assault, many battles turn on their impressive holding power.

Bran’s Protector",Pet: 'Bran Stark',SIF109,10207,2021,Character: *May only be fielded in an army including Bran Stark.*,,"It began when Bran Stark was paralyzed in a fall from a tower in Winterfell. During his convalescence, Summer defended him from a would-be assassin, confirming the bond between the Stark children and their direwolves. Hodor, a massive man of immense strength, but limited intellect, served as Bran’s legs once young Stark could leave his bed. In a way, the trio function as one individual, a being of loyalty, honor, and intelligence."

Ferocious Assault",,SIF104,10208,S04,,,"Umber Greataxes combine mobility, defense, and fearsome weaponry to field a unit with superior flexibility. Greataxes will chase down heavier foes, stand firm against charges, and deliver a devastating assault with their signature weapons. While not specialized in any particular combat doctrine, an experienced commander can deploy them as needed, to shore up exposed weaknesses in their own defenses or exploit an enemy’s poor judgment."

Order: Mark Target",,SIF107,10209,S05,,,"The Crannogman Trackers are never what one would call a front-line unit. Lightly armed and lightly armored, Trackers stand little chance in formal engagments. What Trackers lack in direct damage, however, they more than make up for in their speed and ability to disrupt and confuse enemy formations, all the while combining their speed and mobility with deadly hit-and-run tactics to avoid direct engagments."

Rickon’s childlike tantrums and fits of rage translated themselves to Shaggydog, a dangerous situation as even young direwolves can be deadly. In armed conflicts, however, Shaggydog’s fearsome protectiveness and savagery were right at home. None could threaten Rickon without facing fangs and fury."

They can be relied upon to hold the field against long odds, and dish out punishment as well as they can take it. Every man would willingly lay down his life for their lord, all the more so as Lord Eddard Stark would do the same.

Rally Banner",,SIF108,10213,S05,,,"Heavily armed, heavily armored, and with all the speed that cavalry commands, House Tully’s Cavaliers are renowned for their devastating charges that can shatter even the hardest enemy line. The mere threat of an imminent charge forces enemy commanders to respond, allowing the Cavalier commander to project force against an enemy line without even engaging. A wise commander will have troops standing ready to exploit the chaos Cavaliers leave in their wake."

Resolute Strikes",,SIF111,10214,S04,,,"The She-Bears of House Mormont style their kit and tactics after the Lady Alysane Mormont. They’re powerful women, known for their strength, outfitted in thick leather and plate. Their weapons are two-handed maces, capable of crushing a heavy helm or caving in a chest plate in a single blow. The She-Bears are fanatically devoted to the Mormont cause, and their strong armor and resolve allow them to stand and fight where other units fall."

Stand Your Ground!",,SIF114/SIF001A,10215,S04,,,"Few things are more terrifying for charging cavalry than a line of hardened spearmen with shields locked and spears leveled, particularly true when those soldiers march under the white sun banner. Karstark’s Spearmen are perfect cover for a battle line’s vulnerable flanks where cavalry do their most devastating work. Kitted with chain and leather, they can absorb their share of hits, but are not suited as a dedicated vanguard on their own."

Disrupt",,SIF112,10216,S04,,,"As befitting the house sigil of a great bear, the troops known colloquially as House Mormont Bruisers hit hard and go down fighting. Their light armor consists mostly of padded leather and light chain, giving them decent mobility. The last thing an opponent wants to face are these troops on a flank. When suffering losses, Bruisers only become more dangerous, vowing blood for blood and often taking their enemies with them."

Flail /
Unleashed Ferocity",,SIF113,10217,S04,,,"House Karstark of Karhold is one of House Stark’s most faithful bannermen. When House Stark calls for aid, loyalist forces are quickly marshalled and sent into the field. While armed primarily with flails and shields, their main weapon is a truly steadfast belief in their cause. Wounds that might seem to put a man down will not bother them. They will simply refuse to break and run against a foe that they have a numerical advantage against."

Poisoned Tridents",Rules: 50201,SIF117,10218,2021,,,"The Crannogman Bog Devils are some of the most feared ambush soldiers in all of Westeros. Vassals of the Reed family, they are adept at blending in with swampy terrain. Their light armor keeps them from being bogged down in their chosen terrain, while their poisoned tridents deal an agonizing death to their foes. After an attack, the Bog Devils simply melt away back into the undergrowth, leaving nothing but the dead and dying."

Executioner’s Axe",,SIF118,10219,2021,,,"House Umber is not renowned for its cavalry, yet what they possess is as deadly as any in Westeros. Ravagers aren’t as heavily armored as some cavalry, but they strike with unbridled fury. Allowing a line of Ravagers to charge an enemy from the flank or rear is to invite a swift and terrible death. They’re fast, efficient, and resilient. Perfect troops for the North where survival depends on swift and merciless killing strokes."

Furious Swing",,SIF003/SIF003/SIF406/SIF406,10301,S05,,,"Although considered a myth by most southern Westerosi lords, the Savage Giants beyond the Wall are all too real, as the Night’s Watch will attest. These huge creatures wear no armor, and wield little more than crude mammoth bones or tree trunks. Yet, this is all they really need. A single giant can lay waste to the heaviest infantry, and virtually ignore a line of charging knights. Only raw numbers or mighty siege weapons can bring a Giant down."

Free Folk Trappers prep the battlefield with hindering snares and artful traps. Such tactics rarely produce more than temporary casualties, though their intent is not to kill. Cavalry units must tread carefully, lest their mounts suffer, and infantry advance slowly for fear of the same. All the while trappers rain arrows down upon these beleaguered formations."

While not suited as a vanguard, the Spearwives make for superior flankers, both on assault and for protection against charges. Their weapons may be crude, but they’re plentiful, cheap, and the Spearwives hurl them with deadly accuracy. Intelligent commanders can make full use of this capability."

In battle, one might not think bone weapons and armor would be terribly effective against steel, yet an auroch’s jawbone on a thick wooden haft can deliver a surprising blow, even to a man in plate armor.

Their spiked maces can easily dispatch enemies, but are more effective for the fear their brutality creates. Bolton Cutthroats make sport of downed foes or, worse for the opponent, take them prisoner to suffer a much more agonizing fate."
Bolton,Blackguards,,6,Infantry,4,[M]Spiked Flail,4+,6.5.4,,,,3+,6+,"Spiked Flail /
Horrific Visage",,SIF005,11002,2021,,,"The ruthlessness of House Bolton’s Blackguards is known by every enemy force they face. Their vicious spiked flails render heavy shields only moderately effective. Being the heaviest troops in House Bolton’s arsenal, the Blackguards can be relied upon to take and hold any position on the battlefield."
Bolton,Dreadfort Archers,,6,Infantry,5,[RL]Ruthless Volley,3+,7.7.4,[M]Short Sword,5+,5.4.3,5+,7+,Ruthless Volley,,SIF005/SIF523,11003,S05,,,"When it comes to the most horrific methods of war, designed to maximize terror as much as damage, one need look no further than House Bolton. Their Dreadfort archers will gleefully let loose savage volleys of arrows, aimed towards their enemies, without regard for their comrades mixed in the melee. Sure, a few allies may sustain injuries, but the disregard for life that House Bolton breeds isn’t only for their foes. "

Tracker’s Bow / 
Blade and Fang",,SIF005,11004,2021,,,"Trained to corner and bring down even heavy infantry, the Bastard’s Girls are best utilized as flankers or in pursuit of fleeing foes. While they do not possess the armor to counter a determined assault, enemies suffering from their handlers’ wounding arrows make for easy prey. A fat bounty can be expected for handlers bringing down enemy commanders to await Ramsay Bolton’s ‘entertainments’ following battle."

War Flail /
Intimidating Presence",,SIF005,11005,2021-S02,,,"The so-called Flayed Men rank among the heaviest cavalry employed by even the largest houses in the War of the Five Kings. With thick steel armor (blackened, of course), heavy shields, and even protective barding for the horses, the Flayed Men are capable of truly devastating charges and can endure in the line for a short time. Their signature war flails render most defenses only marginal at best, but their terriying visage remains their most vital weapon."

Impaling Spear",,SIF522,11006,2021,,,"House Bolton’s Spearmen are indoctrinated in the combat ethic of causing fear and panic among the enemy ranks. Their helmets and shields are designed with extra spikes purely for terrifying effect. The spearmen are trained to strike at points on foes that will cause maximum pain but not kill their opponents, leaving plenty of prisoners for the sadists in House Bolton to do with as they will after battle."

Gang-Up",,SIF010,11101,2021,,,"Every force needs fodder, an unfortunate truth in war. And yet, there’s fodder holding the line at knifepoint and fodder that steps up of its own accord. The Brotherhood’s Peasant Levy are mostly volunteers, which sets them above conscripts. They are most efficient in great numbers and fighting alongside experienced warriors, disrupting enemy lines. Enemy commanders would be unwise to dismiss them as mere rabble."

Brotherwood Armaments",,SIF010,11102,2021,,,"The Brotherhood Without Banners is technically an outlaw band, acting in service to any  lord who fights for the realm’s justice, working towards bringing peace swiftly to the kingdoms.  As such, they’re seen as idealists (and fanatics), and their Men-At-Arms are staunch professionals willing to fight to the bitterest of ends in the name of justice. They serve  best in the line, grinding the enemy to dust."

Hidden Shot",,SIF010,11103,2021,,,"Archers in more formal forces often wear brightly colored uniforms, stand in perfect rows, and fire volley after volley into enemy troops, bringing death on feathered shafts. The Brotherhood Without Banners, however, has other ideas. While their archers are quite capable of such deadly rain, they function best from ambush positions, trained to sow chaos  and confusion in enemy ranks to soften those lines for an easier assault from any angle."

Rally The Smallfolk",,SIF014,11104,2021,,,"Former knights of renown both great and small, the Brotherhood’s Sworn Knights are among the most skilled in all of Westeros, lured away from their lords by a greater calling. As such, they’re nigh unbreakable, and often serve as the force around which many Brotherhood battles are designed. While terrain will usually dictate their employment, a Brotherhood commander who can set up for their deadly charge will see victory more often than not."
